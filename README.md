---

## Description

### Short
*"Kubernetes operator for direct API control using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Manage pods, scaling, and more with AI-driven precision."*

### About
*"The `kubernetes-mcp-operator` empowers AI-driven cluster management by embedding a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server within a Kubernetes-native operator. Unlike traditional tools, it communicates directly with the Kubernetes API serverâ€”no `kubectl` requiredâ€”offering tight, real-time control over resources like pods and deployments. Use it to check pod status, scale applications, or extend cluster capabilities with custom MCP tools, all while leveraging Kubernetesâ€™ scalability and security. Ideal for developers and operators seeking a seamless bridge between AI workflows and Kubernetes infrastructure. Contributions welcome!"*
